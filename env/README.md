# Environment Variable Files

Store environment-specific Terraform variable definitions in this directory.

Create a separate `.tfvars` file for each environment (e.g., `dev.tfvars`, `staging.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`).
These files typically define values such as the environment name, region, and other settings.
